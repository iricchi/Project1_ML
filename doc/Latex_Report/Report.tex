\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
Here we should start to write something like: we have to do a lot because we didn't do anything actually ! (kidding) But I think we have to work a lot, anyway!\\

\textbf{TO REMEMBER:} We have to do also the file README

\section{Fake section}
I have set up this document as an article of 2 column. Is it ok for you?

\section{Exemple of referencese}
I put a file called ``bibliography.bib'' where we should put our references and cite in this way \cite{internet}.

\printbibliography
