# Data analysis and prediction models for the Higgs boson Machine Learning Challenge

## introduction

## Prerequisites
No external libraries have been used for this project, in order to run the jupyter notebooks the test.csv and train.csv datasets must be extracted 
from the data.zip file and placed on the same directory as the rest of the code.

## Running the tests
In order to run the training of the model open the run.py file, the training follows this steps:

1)ABBSCOAIS: vediamosc cocme esce

2)USSUUS: Uscufaa un caos

3)MARONN: mannaggiaaaaaa
